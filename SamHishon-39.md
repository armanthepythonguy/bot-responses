**Startup Idea Not Provided**

Your message appears to cut off after "/start" without describing the actual startup idea or problem you're solving. I can't perform the requested research, validation, market analysis, or gather sources without knowing what the idea is (e.g., "an AI-powered fitness app for remote workers" or whatever it may be).

Please reply with the full details of your idea/problem, and I'll dive in immediately:
- Brutal, honest validation based on current market trends/stats.
- Social posts (X/Twitter, Reddit, blogs) filtered for 2025-2026 (noting: as of my last knowledge cutoff in 2024, no such future posts exist, so I'll pull the most recent/relevant older ones and note timestamps).
- Market data, size guesstimates (step-by-step), competitors.
- All sources linked for your review.
- End-to-end validation like I'm pitching this to my own VC for funding.

Once you provide it, expect a comprehensive report structured like this (preview):

### 1. Problem Validation via Social Chatter
- Key posts/links (latest first, or recent proxies).

### 2. Market Overview
